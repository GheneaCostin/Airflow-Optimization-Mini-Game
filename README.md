ðŸŒ€ Airflow Optimization Mini-Game

A Python-based interactive mini-game to visualize airflow over 2D airfoils and blunt wings.
Users can experiment with different wing types, angle of attack, and see streamlines and pressure coefficients in real time.

This project is perfect for demonstrating aerodynamic concepts and building a portfolio project for STEM or F1-related roles.

âœ¨ Features

Airfoil selection:
Choose from NACA 0012, 2412, 4412, or blunt wings.

Blunt wing styles:

Rectangle: flat blunt wing

Rounded: fully smooth blunt wing (capsule-shaped)

Angle-of-Attack (AoA) control:
Rotate the wing and see how airflow and pressure change.

Streamline visualization:
Real-time airflow plots showing velocity magnitude around the wing.

Pressure Coefficient (Cp) plots:
Color-coded Cp contours highlight high- and low-pressure regions, illustrating lift generation.

Interactive GUI:
Built with Tkinter and Matplotlib, lightweight and easy to run.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tutorial

1. Launch the mini-game:

2. Select an Airfoil:

  Choose NACA 0012, 2412, 4412, or Blunt Wing from the dropdown.

2.b If you select a Blunt Wing:

  Pick a style: Rectangle (flat) or Rounded (capsule).

3. Set Angle of Attack (AoA):

  Use the slider to rotate the wing.

  Observe how airflow changes around it.

4. Show Pressure Coefficient (Cp) (optional):

5. Check the Show Cp Plot box to see high- and low-pressure areas.

6. Update the Plot:

7. Click Update to refresh the visualization.

  Streamlines and Cp plots respond to your selections.

8. Experiment!

  Compare different airfoils and blunt wings.

  Observe which shapes are more aerodynamic (smoother streamlines, higher top-surface velocity).
