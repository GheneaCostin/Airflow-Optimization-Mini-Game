ðŸŒ€ Airflow Optimization Mini-Game

A Python-based interactive mini-game to visualize airflow over 2D airfoils and blunt wings.
Users can experiment with different wing types, angle of attack, and see streamlines and pressure coefficients in real time.

This project is perfect for demonstrating aerodynamic concepts and building a portfolio project for STEM or F1-related roles.

âœ¨ Features

Airfoil selection:
Choose from NACA 0012, 2412, 4412, or blunt wings.

Blunt wing styles:

Rectangle: flat blunt wing

Rounded: fully smooth blunt wing (capsule-shaped)

Angle-of-Attack (AoA) control:
Rotate the wing and see how airflow and pressure change.

Streamline visualization:
Real-time airflow plots showing velocity magnitude around the wing.

Pressure Coefficient (Cp) plots:
Color-coded Cp contours highlight high- and low-pressure regions, illustrating lift generation.

Interactive GUI:
Built with Tkinter and Matplotlib, lightweight and easy to run.
